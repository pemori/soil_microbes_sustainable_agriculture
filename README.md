# Soil Microbes and Sustainable Agriculture Research ðŸŒ±

Welcome to the repository for our research on the role of soil microbes in sustainable agriculture, as featured in our recent publication in [Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2024.109053). This repository contains the code used in the study, allowing other researchers to reproduce our findings, explore the data further, or adapt our methodologies for their own research.
